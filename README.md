# HRI_tasks_dataset
A collection of data obtained by simulating simple tasks in Human-Robot teach-by-demonstration scenarios.


The dataset concerns toy tasks that a human should teach to a robot. The number of task repetitions is limited in the dataset since the human should demonstrate the task to the robot only a few times.

The data contains images (collected with a Kinect camera) and objects' positions (acquired with a motion capture system and shared through CSV files) over time. 

The collected data concerns tasks such as (i) assembling the legs of a toy table and (ii) building a stack of objects. Both tasks have variations where the human should validate each step through a pen (e.g., to simulate a quality check procedure).
